# CGMH-CXR
This project contains NLP disease classification outcome, and the preliminary resultï¼Œ to demonstration the procedure of AI model application into medicine image classification domain. 


# Introduction:

Chest X-ray image data is often used in routine medical operations, and AI algorithms are used to collaborate with imaging specialists for data annotation. There have been many research results showing that a large number of chest X-ray image data can be classified  into  Normal  or Abnormal through chest X-ray data, in addition to reducing the work pressure of imaging doctors. Through the human-machine cooperation model, the sensitivity of chest diseases diagnosis is also improved, and the chance of misinterpretation is reduced.

# Data processing step:

1.	Data labeling First use NLP tools to label 14 types of chest diseases. The classification results are shown in Figure 1.
2.	The doctor will adjust the classification results of the NLP algorithm based on the X-ray report.
3.	The current Chest x-ray AI algorithm has an accuracy rate of over 80%
